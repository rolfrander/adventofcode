So setting up an environment for javascript-developement wasn't as easy as apt-get...

First I had to get [depot_tools](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools):
```
$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
```

Then I could set up the [V8 build environment](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Using%20Git):
```
$ fetch v8
```

Finally ready to build:
```
$ cd v8
$ make native
```

There is no `make install`...

Trying to install by symlinking d8 to /usr/local/bin, I get a segfault. It 
[turns out](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/v8-users/3fQiwMi6_jc)
that I also need `natives_blob.bin` and `snapshot_blob.bin`, but
symlinking those doesn't do the trick. Maybe it doesn't like symlinks,
I don't know. However, setting `GYP_DEFINES="v8_use_external_startup_data=0"`
and rebuilding does the trick:
```
$ build/gyp_v8
$ make native
```

But then I started looking for file-API... It turns out you aren't really expected to run plain V8, use node.js:
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

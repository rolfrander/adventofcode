# adventofcode

Solutions to the puzzles at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).
This is a learning excercise, and I will usea different language each
day. The goal is to find an elegant and idiomatic solution in each language.

* Day 1: [Emacs lisp](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day01.el)
* Day 2: [Erlang](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day02.erl)
* Day 3: [Haskell](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day03.hs)
* Day 4: [C](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day04.c) (Not a very elegant program, but C is not an elegant language...)

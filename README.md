Solutions to the puzzles at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).
This is a learning excercise, and I will usea different language each
day. The goal is to find an elegant and idiomatic solution in each language.

* Day 1: [Emacs lisp](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day01.el)
* Day 2: [Erlang](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day02.erl)
* Day 3: [Haskell](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day03.hs)
* Day 4: [C](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day04.c)
* Day 5: [Perl6](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day05.pl)
* Day 6: I tried doing this in [J](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day06.ijs), but I couldn't. The syntax is just to terse, and after two weeks I gave up and switched to [numpy](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day06.py). The whole task was done in 30 minutes...
* Day 7: [Common Lisp](https://github.com/rolfrander/adventofcode/blob/master/day07.lisp)
